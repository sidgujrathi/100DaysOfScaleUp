# 100 Days Of Scale Up - Log

### Day 0: October 18, 2023

**Progress**: I have joined 100 days challenge, Created github repo and started logging.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to have this challenge generic since on daily basis I am working on different things. So I have decided to have this challenge as 100 days of scale up. I will be working on different things which will help me to scale up in my career.

Also I wanted to make sure I spent at least 1 hour daily on this challenge and log my progress. This will also give me a chance to learn new things and share my experience with others consistently.
