# #100DaysOfScaleUp

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in India, currently serving as a Technical Lead at a leading organization. My role covers Project Planning, Technical Guidance, Collaboration, and Team Management. As part of a 100-day challenge, I'm on a journey to level up in these domains.

Beyond my daily responsibilities, I'm gearing up for the next milestone in my software engineering career. This challenge keeps me committed, disciplined, and eager to share my experiences along the way. ðŸš€
